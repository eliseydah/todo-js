This is a basic webpage created as a part of my practice in HTML and CSS. The goal was to learn and apply fundamental concepts of web development, including layout design, styling, and responsive techniques.

## Features
Basic Structure: The webpage uses semantic HTML5 tags like <header>, <main>, <footer> and more.
Responsive Layout: The page is styled to look good on different screen sizes using flexbox.
Custom Styles: Custom CSS is used for colors, fonts, and spacing.
Flexbox and Grid Layout: Layouts are built using modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid.

### Setup 
1. Clone the repository:
```bash 
git clone  https://github.com/eliseydah/todo-js.git
```
2. Go to the directory of the project: 
```bash
cd landing
```
3. Open the file `Landing.html` in a browser
